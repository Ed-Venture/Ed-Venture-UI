## Problem Statement

-   The current education system requires a more efficient and effective way of conducting classes and assessments. With the increasing demand for online learning due to the pandemic, there is a need for an ed tech web app that allows users to create classes, generate quizzes, and view their rankings in real-time. The app should be built using React to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

-   The problem is that existing platforms often lack the necessary features or have a steep learning curve, which makes it difficult for teachers and students to adapt quickly. Furthermore, the lack of real-time feedback and personalized ranking systems often hinder the progress of students.

## Proposed Solution

-   To address these challenges, our ed tech web app will provide users with a simple and intuitive interface that allows them to create classes and generate quizzes in just a few clicks. The app will also provide real-time feedback and personalized ranking systems, which will enable students to track their progress and identify areas that need improvement.

-   By using our ed tech web app, teachers and students can collaborate and learn more effectively, leading to improved academic performance and better outcomes.
