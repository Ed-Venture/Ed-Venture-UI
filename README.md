## Problem Statement

-   The current education system requires a more efficient and effective way of conducting classes and assessments. With the increasing demand for online learning due to the pandemic, there is a need for an ed tech web app that allows users to create classes, generate quizzes, and view their rankings in real time. The app should be built using React to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

-   The problem is that existing platforms often lack the necessary features or have a steep learning curve, which makes it difficult for teachers and students to adapt quickly. Furthermore, the lack of real-time feedback and personalized ranking systems often hinders the progress of students.

## Proposed Solution

-   To address these challenges, our ed tech web app will provide users with a simple and intuitive interface that allows them to create classes and generate quizzes in just a few clicks. The app will also provide real-time feedback and personalized ranking systems, which will enable students to track their progress and identify areas that need improvement.

-   By using our ed tech web app, teachers and students can collaborate and learn more effectively, leading to improved academic performance and better outcomes.
